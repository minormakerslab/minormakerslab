## Highlight: Makers Lab X Biodesign!

In the 2021 and 2022 editions of the minor, we partnered up with the [Biodesign Challenge](https://biodesignchallenge.org/), an international competition and education program to support and shape the first generation of biodesigners. In 2022, our team was one of the six finalists and our Biomaterials instructor Sam Edens received the prize for most outstanding instructor of the competition. The 2023 edition of the minor will not participate in the Biodesign Challenge due to clashing schedules but we will incorporate biodesign into the minor.

Last year's syllabus (semester 2 of 2021-2022) gives an indication of the current program. All information may be subject to change. Please note that we will not participate in the Biodesign Challenge in 2023 but work on projects that will be just as fabulous and crazy as in previous editions.
