In 2018 the minor worked together with research partners: Fashion Technology & Research and the Knowledge Mile together with the Visual Methodologies Collective.


## Making Sense(s)

*Question: How might we imagine future senses using technologies? What makes for a meaningful bodily extension?*

Students: Kristin Jakubek (AMFI) & Frida Eriksson (Communication)
Research partner: dr. Rebecca Breuer, Fashion Technology & Research

Outcomes: A series of tangible prototypes that explore 1) the body as a technology, 2) how the senses can be misled, and 3) possible body extensions of the future. Additionally, this team developed a set of design prompts to rethink and re-imagine the body, using thought-provoking What if..? questions.

## Making Things Visible 

*Question: How can we visualize our (possible) relationships to urban nature in a way that sparks discussion and engagement?*

Students: Barbara Krantz (AMFI), Kaj van der Ster (HBO-ICT) & Melvin Stans (HBO ICT)
Research partners: the Knowledge Mile & the Visual Methodologies Collective

Outcomes: A series of street tiles and an Augmented Reality app that brings to life the various attitudes we have to urban nature, and explores what other relationships with nature and their consequences might look like

## Naya Data

Question: How do design decisions of a measuring device influence the gathering (or creation) of data? How can we make people aware of the consequences such design choices in the system design may have?

Students: Nisse van Rossum (AMFI) & Yannick Mulder (CMD)
Partners: Wouter Meys, Citizen Data Lab

Outcomes: An interactive installation that deconstructs all layers of a generic sensing device that allows citizens to monitor their surroundings. How does each layer (design, technical, material, code) influence the way data is captured (or created)? What does it mean if such data is always slightly colored? It allows visitors to explore these questions by interacting with the installation

## Electrical Presence Glove

*Question: How might we imagine future senses using technologies? What makes for a meaningful bodily extension?*

Students: Geert Lens (HBO-ICT), Anton Westin (Communication), Jaap Spruitenburg (AMFI)
Research partner: dr. Rebecca Breuer, Fashion Technology & Research

Outcomes: An interactive sleeve that detects the presence of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and vibrates when it picks up spikes in electromagnetic activity, allowing you to “get a sense” for when such potentially harmful signals are present in your vicinity.

## The Wardrobe as System

*Question: How can we observe the life cycles and value of clothing items in a wardrobe?*

Students: Jesse Feenstra (CMD) & Guillaume Dumas (HBO-ICT)
Research partner: dr. Irene Maldini, Fashion Technology & Research

Outcomes: WardProbe: a research tool that asks people to log their motivations and emotions in relationship to the clothing in their wardrobe. The probe helps researchers understand the logics by which people make choices in terms of fashion consumption.
