We explore the fascinating world of soft robotics. Soft robotics is a bio-inspired approach that combines the collaboration of biology, engineering, design, sensing and control. It investigates the functional principles of shape, movement, control and sensing of soft biological systems. It reverse-engineers these principles and uses it for new applications.
