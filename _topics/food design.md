This theme combines making skills with food design. You will discover the different possibilities of DIY biomaterials and experiment with making them yourself. By doing so you will dive deeper into the world of bio-design. You will also learn how to use your digital fabrication skills to make molds and how to cast them. You will tinker with and explore the use of shapes, textures, and colors. You will combine this in the design of a food experience.
