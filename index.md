## Minor Makers Lab: Exploring Material Futures at AUAS

This semester course taught at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences challenges you to think critically about the way you make and design. You acquire hands-on knowledge and skills that enable you to experience how things might be made differently and discover alternatives to reduce the environmental impact of man-made things.
