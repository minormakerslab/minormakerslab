# Expo Minor Makers Lab - Join our guided tour on Thursday 25 June
On Thursday 25 June, students of the Minor Makers Lab will present their projects on biomaterials, RIVM regulations, fashion, dating, packaging, exercise and DIY maker cultures. The students engaged in self-directed projects from home, making do with the limited tools and materials at hand. From their kitchens, gardens and bedrooms, our students engaged with challenges around the lived realities of the COVID-19 crisis, often combined with a strong sense of homebrewed material activism. 

### Join our guided tour on Thursday 25 June 4.00 PM via [this zoom link](https://bit.ly/makerexpo2020). 

## Minor Makers Lab: self-directed projects from home 
We arrive at the end of a semester that asked us all to reflectively engage with the conditions that make making as we know it possible. Repeatedly hitting our heads against our often invisible reliance on facilities and supply chains has been a struggle and a blessing, but seeing their interdependencies more clearly certainly encouraged us to take a radical turn in terms of the materials we choose to work with as makers. We experimented with bio-based materials and learned to embrace the fact that we would not be exerting the kind of control we are used to having over materials we know and work with when we use industrial machines. Limitations turned into openings and vice versa as we were practically confronted with the ways tools and staple materials inform what we can imagine.

# Minor Makers Lab: Making as Research

*Exploring Sustainable High and Low Tech Materials through Critical Crafts*

This minor challenges you to think critically about the way you make and design. You acquire hands-on knowledge and skills that enable you to experience how things might be made differently and discover alternatives to reduce the environmental impact of man-made things. 

## Making today
In the throw-away culture that dominates contemporary society it has become the new normal, for makers and consumers alike, to buy (semi-manufactured) products cheaply and conveniently and easily discard them. For example, many people find it easier to buy a new phone instead of repairing it. This is partly due to the non-transparency of the object, the lack of knowledge about its material structure, the complexity of its inner workings, and the system(s) in which it is embedded, which discourage altering, hacking and repairing. This discrepancy between making and consuming is also visible in other industries such as automobiles, electronics and fashion. We lose foundational knowledge of all the things involved in making something from scratch, what materials can do, and how we might connect, disconnect and (re)shape things, as high-tech innovation transforms fabrication processes into complex global systems. 

## About the program
In this program we go back to the fundamentals of materials and how things are made. We rethink the wealth of traditional material knowledge and craftsmanship in order to meet the demands of the 21st century. We re-envision them in the context of contemporary high-tech crafts and sustainable digital fabrication to rediscover the potential of local materials and traditions. With this minor we aim to redefine the position of the maker and her role in relation to the commons (the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of society), by taking a DIY and open-source approach to high-tech and (smarter) smart materials that are largely compostable, locally sourced, and documented with cultural/historical awareness, accessible for anyone to use.

### Week 1-10: Coursework
The first ten weeks you will dive into digital craftsmanship, material research and storytelling. We will work on a range of digital crafts and techniques, in order to allow you to fully and independently engage with the high tech equipment, like 3D printers and laser cutters, available to you in the Makers Lab: our digital fabrication workshop. You will also learn foundational material knowledge by cooking, curing, growing, modifying and connecting materials like bioplastics, crystals, natural pigments, fibres and programmable materials that respond to touch or heat or change shape. By experimenting and researching independently and collaboratively, you are challenged to discover techniques and combinations and make meaningful contributions to a shared material archive. 

### Week 11-21: Projects
From week 11-20 you choose an area of interest and develop a research project. This can take the form of exploring and expanding (the creative applications of) existing techniques or materials, or developing a tool or machine to support making processes. These outcomes are all shown at the class expo and documented under a creative commons licence in the material archive. As this is an interdisciplinary program with participants from very different fields, students can expect a lot of freedom to follow their own interests and be creative. Tutors, researchers, and designers and makers from the professional field will support you in critically reflecting on your experiments, contextualizing your creative practice and understand where and why your work could be or become relevant. 
Leerdoelen / Competenties

## Learning objectives
At the end of this minor you have developed yourself as a material storyteller and critical maker. You bring valuable hands-on knowledge and skills to any professional environment: you can work with conceptual frameworks to initiate question-driven design processes for exploring sustainable material development with an awareness of the politics, cultures and histories of made objects. This allows you to develop an ethical contemporary maker practice and share your expertise in a way that allows others to build on and learn from your work.

### Digital Craftsmanship 
The ability to safely and creatively use lab equipment and tools to design and fabricate 2D and 3D objects and textures, make functional molds, create and program sensors and actuators, following recipes to recreate and modify bio-polymers and pigments. 

### Material Research & Documentation
The ability to analyse the properties of materials and their relationship to tools and production processes used, in order to identify areas for further question-led material exploration. Knowing how, when and what to reference and document in order for others to reproduce, replicate and continue building on your work.

### Argumentation & Storytelling
The ability to develop stimulating scenarios and use effective (material) storytelling techniques to build an argument for the future relevance, urgency and creative potential of their materials research, presented as part of an exhibition.

## Assessment information
All course is structured in three domains, each existing of a foundational part (I) and an applied part (II). All parts are graded with various assignments (I) and portfolio assessments (II). 

  * *Digital Craftsmanship I & II - 10 EC*
  * *Materials Research & Documentation I & II - 10 EC*
  * *Argumentation & Storytelling I & II - 10 EC*
