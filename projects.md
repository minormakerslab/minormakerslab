The second half of this minor program offers a unique opportunity to apply what you learned while working with a transdisciplinary team on a research project. You’ll rediscover the potential of traditional materials and techniques. You’ll learn how to use them in the context of high-tech crafts and sustainable fabrication.

This is our archive of our student project work for each year.
